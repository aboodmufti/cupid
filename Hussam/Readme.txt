Purpose: cuPID is a software that allows students to register in projects created
         by administrators. after all students are registered in the project,
         the administrator will run an algorithm that would determine the best team
         matches based on the qualifications filled in the student profile by each
         student.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sources: We worked on this project using Qt creator and all libraries used were
         inside Qt creator.

The .tar file includes:

1) the cuPID folder (which includes all source code and database)

2) this ReadMe file

Compilation and execution:

To compile and run please do the following:

1) click on the "cupid_UI.pro" shorcut located in cuPID folder

Misc. notes to TA:

1) In the project page: admin can view a student’s profile page by clicking on the student from the list of students

2) In the administrator’s main page: the administrator can view a project by clicking on the project from the list of projects

3) Unpublished projects are not visible to students. The administrator must publish these projects for the student to be able to join them if they wish

4) If the administrator edits a published project, the project is no longer published unless the administrator publishes it again (as means of confirmation of changes)

5) If the student logs in for the first time without proceeding to edit their profile, then this student is not saved in the database

6) To create a new administrator account, just type in any username you wish and
   click "submit"
